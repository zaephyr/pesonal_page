## Introduction
This is simple portfolio website I created using technologies I learned so far. Going serverless seemed right for this kind of website and implementation of `nuxtjs/content` which renders `Markdown`into standard HTML was next logical step. For example these project info pages are made with Markdown. 

I needed some backend functionality for e-mailing that's why hosting on `Netlify` and using their `Lambda Functions` in combination with `Mailgun`.  

## Build With
* [Nuxt.js](https://nuxtjs.org/)
* [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/)
